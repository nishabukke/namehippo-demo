                                responsive, making for quick domain transfers. A dedicated Namehippo agent will manage your domain transfer from beginning to end, ensuring a secure and easy transaction. They will manage the receipt of the domain into one of Namehippo’s secure registrar accounts and then complete the transfer to you.</p> 
                            <p class="m-0 fw-semibold">1. Verification and registrar choice</p>
                            <p>After we receive the payment and verify it, we will reach out via email to confirm which registrar you want the domain transferred to. We also provide a link to our tracking system, where you can communicate with us, check on the status of your transfer, view your invoice, and download your logo files.</p>
                            <p>In most cases, if a domain is moved between accounts at a single registrar, the transfer is quick and usually completes within 48 hours. If a domain changes registrars (in other words, you would like to move it away from where it is currently registered), the transfer is slower. The total transfer time can then be anywhere from 48 hours to 7 days.</p>

                          <p>The Namehippo lease-to-own program is available as an alternative to purchasing the name outright. You're able to buy the domain name with over monthly installments, and at the end of the lease period, if all payments are complete, you would be the new owner of the domain name.</p>
                            <p>Once you complete the checkout process for a leased domain, you will be contacted by a Namehippo agent who will help manage your lease. The domain will be transferred from the seller to a Namehippo escrow account, ensuring a secure hold on the domain during the lease term. We will transfer the domain to you once all payments are complete.</p>
                            <p>During the lease, you're entitled to use the domain name for your website and email; your agent will guide you through that.</p>
                            <p> Each month you will continue to receive an invoice with a balance statement. You have the right to cancel the lease any time or complete all payments early to own the domain outright.</p>

                            <p>The .com extension is a brand in itself. As the default domain extension of the internet, having a .com domain that is an exact match to your brand name has numerous advantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="fw-semibold">Familiarity : </span> People are familiar with .com. Most of the brands and websites they already trust, use the .com extension. Therefore, it serves as a subtle indicator that your business is a legitimate one. A recent study by the NCC Group, a global expert in cybersecurity and risk mitigation, found that roughly half of the consumers are uncomfortable visiting websites ending with a non .com extension, and only 9% are comfortable doing so.</li>
                                <li><span class="fw-semibold">Brand Protection : </span> When you own the .com version of a domain name, you have the official online version of that name. Owning an exact-match .com can protect your brand name, as it is unlikely another serious business would use the same name when the .com extension is taken.</li>
                                <li><span class="fw-semibold">Easy to Communicate : </span> .com domains are also easy to communicate. When people hear or see your business name without a TLD, they will inevitably assume it ends in .com, making it easy for them to find you online.</li>

However, there may well be other businesses that are using the same brand name. In fact, with common keyword names, it is likely. That is why owning the .com is so essential. In holding the .com, you immediately establish your business as the most official version of that name. It's unlikely any serious business is going to use a brand name where the .com domain is already in use. Many companies believe that owning the matching .com version of a business name provides more protection for their brand than a trademark.</p>

The price of registration varies at each registrar, but it generally ends up being around $10-15 per year for a .com domain name. Registration is annual but can be paid up for years in advance, which we suggest you do.</p>

                              <p>A brand name is a name that you use to identify a family of products, services, or a single line of products or services that a company offers. For instance, Apple is the brand name used on most products manufactured by Apple, Inc. In this example, the business name and brand name are the same, a common use case.</p>
                              <p>Your brand name is who you are to your customers. It is the pillar your business's public image will be built around. The products or services you offer can also have their own brand names. You may want to create new brand names for products or services that differ from your core business offering, for example:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>UberEats - Food delivery by Uber</li>
                                <li>Amazon Web Services - Cloud computing from Amazon</li>
                                <li>Google Maps - Web mapping service from Google</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p class="fw-semibold">Registered Business Name</p>
                              <p>A business name is the legally registered name of your business. You'll use your business name to create contracts, open bank accounts, pay taxes, and any other administrative related activities. Most business names contain the business's brand name, followed by the company's chosen business structure, for example:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Walmart Inc.</li>
                                    <li>Verizon Inc.</li>
                                    <li>Grasshopper LLC</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>However, they don't necessarily have to be the same. In some cases, the business name is completely different from the brand name. This is most common in large businesses that have multiple brands housed under a single parent company, for example:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Brand Name: Google</li>
                                    <li>Business Name: Alphabet Inc.</li>
                                    <li>Brand Name: MailChimp</li>
                                    <li>Business Name: The Rocket Science Group LLC</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="fw-semibold">Domain Name</p>
                                <p>A domain name is your website name - the internet address where people can access your website. Think of a domain as the address to the online version of your business. Every domain is one-of-a-kind. No website has the same web address as another website.</p>
                                <p>Ideally, your domain name should be an exact match to your brand name. Think of your favorite companies. Odds are, their domain name is identical to their brand name. Apple's domain name is Apple.com; Amazon's domain name is Amazon.com. Having a matching domain ensures that people can easily find your brand online.</p>
